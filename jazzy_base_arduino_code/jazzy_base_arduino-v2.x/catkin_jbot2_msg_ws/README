Custom messages for jbo2.

- Building from this directory:

catkin_make_isolated
catkin_make install
 # creates install/include/jbot2_msgs/jbot2_pwm.h 

#create the arduino compatable include header for messaes
cd install
. setup.bash
rosrun rosserial_arduino make_libraries.py ~/Arduino/libraries
  #will install to ~/Arduino/libraries/ros_lib/jbot2_msgs/jbot2_pwm.h

 install/include/jbot2_msgs/jbot2_pwm.h into same dir as arduino ino file
# Alternately we create full and rpm  package for this into the jbot2 code

#Manuaaly Testing publising to /raw_pwm
#http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/YAMLCommandLine

rostopic pub -r 10 /raw_pwm jbot2_msgs/jbot2_pwm -- '{stamp: now}' 200 1 10 1
  #-- is end of ros pub params (so we can pass negitive numbers)
  #where -r is the rate
  #200 is pwm_left, 1 is duration in milisec (1000 ms = 1 sec)
  #10 is pwm_right, 1 is duration in milisec (1000 ms = 1 sec)
